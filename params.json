Platform specifics should be pushed down to an OS layer (to be implemented), to keep #ifdef in the main code at a minimum\r\n\r\nSee what needs to be done \r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-IE/download/details.aspx?id=19341\r\n\r\n\r\n## Follow the discussion\r\n\r\nThis idea for a c++ .net framework came out from my blog\r\n\r\nhttps://mydeveloperday.wordpress.com/2015/11/27/making-a-c-net-framework-part-1/\r\nhttps://mydeveloperday.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/making-a-c-net-framework-part-2/\r\n\r\nTalk about this repository\r\n\r\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/mydeveloperday/cpp-net-framework](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/mydeveloperday/cpp-net-framework?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\r\n\r\n\r\n## About MyDeveloper Day\r\n\r\nFollow the my development stories at our blog\r\n\r\nhttps://mydeveloperday.wordpress.com/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
